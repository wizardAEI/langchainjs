# Azure ChatOpenAI

[Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/ai-services/openai-service/) is a cloud service to help you quickly develop generative AI experiences with a diverse set of prebuilt and curated models from OpenAI, Meta and beyond.

LangChain.js supports integration with [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/ai-services/openai-service/) using either the dedicated [Azure OpenAI SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/openai/openai) or the [OpenAI SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-node).

You can learn more about Azure OpenAI and its difference with the OpenAI API on [this page](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/overview). If you don't have an Azure account, you can [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) to get started.

## Using the OpenAI SDK

You can use the `ChatOpenAI` class to access OpenAI instances hosted on Azure.

For example, if your Azure instance is hosted under `https://{MY_INSTANCE_NAME}.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/{DEPLOYMENT_NAME}`, you
could initialize your instance like this:

import AzureOpenAI from "@examples/models/chat/integration_azure_openai.ts";

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai
```

import UnifiedModelParamsTooltip from "@mdx_components/unified_model_params_tooltip.mdx";

<UnifiedModelParamsTooltip></UnifiedModelParamsTooltip>

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{AzureOpenAI}</CodeBlock>

If your instance is hosted under a domain other than the default `openai.azure.com`, you'll need to use the alternate `AZURE_OPENAI_BASE_PATH` environment variable.
For example, here's how you would connect to the domain `https://westeurope.api.microsoft.com/openai/deployments/{DEPLOYMENT_NAME}`:

import AzureOpenAIBasePath from "@examples/models/chat/integration_azure_openai_base_path.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{AzureOpenAIBasePath}</CodeBlock>

## Using the Azure OpenAI SDK

You'll first need to install the [`@langchain/azure-openai`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/azure-openai) package:

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install -S @langchain/azure-openai
```

You'll also need to have an Azure OpenAI instance deployed. You can deploy a version on Azure Portal following [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal).

Once you have your instance running, make sure you have the endpoint and key. You can find them in the Azure Portal, under the "Keys and Endpoint" section of your instance.

You can then define the following environment variables to use the service:

```bash
AZURE_OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT=<YOUR_ENDPOINT>
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_KEY>
AZURE_OPENAI_API_EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=<YOUR_EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT_NAME>
```

Alternatively, you can pass the values directly to the `AzureOpenAI` constructor:

```typescript
import { AzureChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/azure-openai";

const model = new AzureChatOpenAI({
  azureOpenAIEndpoint: "<your_endpoint>",
  apiKey: "<your_key>",
  azureOpenAIApiDeploymentName: "<your_embedding_deployment_name",
  model: "<your_model>",
});
```

If you're using Azure Managed Identity, you can also pass the credentials directly to the constructor:

```typescript
import { DefaultAzureCredential } from "@azure/identity";
import { AzureChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/azure-openai";

const credentials = new DefaultAzureCredential();

const model = new AzureChatOpenAI({
  credentials,
  azureOpenAIEndpoint: "<your_endpoint>",
  azureOpenAIApiDeploymentName: "<your_embedding_deployment_name",
  model: "<your_model>",
});
```

### Usage example

import Example from "@examples/models/chat/integration_azure_chat_openai.ts";

<CodeBlock language="text">{Example}</CodeBlock>
