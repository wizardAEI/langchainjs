# Quickstart

The quick start will cover the basics of working with language models.
It will introduce the two different types of models - LLMs and ChatModels.
It will then cover how to use PromptTemplates to format the inputs to these models, and how to use Output Parsers to work with the outputs.
For a deeper conceptual guide into these topics - please see [this page](/docs/modules/model_io/concepts).

## Models

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";
import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

import UnifiedModelParamsTooltip from "@mdx_components/unified_model_params_tooltip.mdx";

<UnifiedModelParamsTooltip></UnifiedModelParamsTooltip>

<Tabs groupId="preferredModel">
  <TabItem value="openai" label="OpenAI" default>

First we'll need to install the LangChain OpenAI integration package:

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai
```

Accessing the API requires an API key, which you can get by creating an account and heading [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). Once we have a key we'll want to set it as an environment variable:

```shell
OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
```

We can then initialize the model:

```typescript
import { OpenAI, ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

const llm = new OpenAI({
  model: "gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct",
});
const chatModel = new ChatOpenAI({
  model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
});
```

If you can't or would prefer not to set an environment variable, you can pass the key in directly via the `apiKey` named parameter when initiating the OpenAI LLM class:

```typescript
const model = new ChatOpenAI({
  apiKey: "<your key here>",
});
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="local" label="Local (using Ollama)">

[Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) allows you to run open-source large language models, such as Llama 2 and Mistral, locally.

First, follow [these instructions](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama) to set up and run a local Ollama instance:

- [Download](https://ollama.ai/download)
- Fetch a model via e.g. `ollama pull mistral`

Then, make sure the Ollama server is running. Next, you'll need to install the LangChain community package:

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community
```

And then you can do:

```typescript
import { Ollama } from "@langchain/community/llms/ollama";
import { ChatOllama } from "@langchain/community/chat_models/ollama";

const llm = new Ollama({
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:11434", // Default value
  model: "mistral",
});
const chatModel = new ChatOllama({
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:11434", // Default value
  model: "mistral",
});
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="anthropic" label="Anthropic" default>

First we'll need to install the LangChain Anthropic integration package:

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/anthropic
```

Accessing the API requires an API key, which you can get by creating an account [here](https://console.anthropic.com/). Once we have a key we'll want to set it as an environment variable:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="..."
```

We can then initialize the model:

```typescript
import { ChatAnthropic } from "@langchain/anthropic";

const chatModel = new ChatAnthropic({
  model: "claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
});
```

If you can't or would prefer not to set an environment variable, you can pass the key in directly via the `apiKey` named parameter when initiating the ChatAnthropic class:

```typescript
const model = new ChatAnthropic({
  apiKey: "<your key here>",
});
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="google" label="Google GenAI" default>

First we'll need to install the LangChain Google GenAI integration package:

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/google-genai
```

Accessing the API requires an API key, which you can get by creating an account [here](https://ai.google.dev/tutorials/setup). Once we have a key we'll want to set it as an environment variable:

```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY="..."
```

We can then initialize the model:

```typescript
import { ChatGoogleGenerativeAI } from "@langchain/google-genai";

const chatModel = new ChatGoogleGenerativeAI({
  model: "gemini-1.0-pro",
});
```

If you'd prefer not to set an environment variable you can pass the key in directly via the `apiKey` named parameter when initiating the `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` class:

```typescript
const model = new ChatGoogleGenerativeAI({
  apiKey: "<your key here>",
});
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

These classes represent configuration for a particular model.
You can initialize them with parameters like `temperature` and others, and pass them around.
The main difference between them is their input and output schemas.

- The LLM class takes a string as input and outputs a string.
- The ChatModel class takes a list of messages as input and outputs a message.

For a deeper conceptual explanation of this difference please see [this documentation](/docs/modules/model_io/concepts#models)

We can see the difference between an LLM and a ChatModel when we invoke it.

```ts
import { HumanMessage } from "@langchain/core/messages";

const text =
  "What would be a good company name for a company that makes colorful socks?";
const messages = [new HumanMessage(text)];

await llm.invoke(text);
// Feetful of Fun

await chatModel.invoke(messages);
/*
  AIMessage {
    content: 'Socks O'Color',
    additional_kwargs: {}
  }
*/
```

The LLM returns a string, while the ChatModel returns a message.

## Prompt Templates

Most LLM applications do not pass user input directly into an LLM. Usually they will add the user input to a larger piece of text, called a prompt template, that provides additional context on the specific task at hand.

In the previous example, the text we passed to the model contained instructions to generate a company name. For our application, it would be great if the user only had to provide the description of a company/product without worrying about giving the model instructions.

PromptTemplates help with exactly this!
They bundle up all the logic for going from user input into a fully formatted prompt.
This can start off very simple - for example, a prompt to produce the above string would just be:

```typescript
import { PromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";

const prompt = PromptTemplate.fromTemplate(
  "What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?"
);
await prompt.format({ product: "colorful socks" });

// What is a good name for a company that makes colorful socks?
```

However, the advantages of using these over raw string formatting are several.
You can "partial" out variables - e.g. you can format only some of the variables at a time.
You can compose them together, easily combining different templates into a single prompt.
For explanations of these functionalities, see the [section on prompts](/docs/modules/model_io/prompts) for more detail.

`PromptTemplate`s can also be used to produce a list of messages.
In this case, the prompt not only contains information about the content, but also each message (its role, its position in the list, etc.).
We can use a `ChatPromptTemplate` created from a list of `ChatMessageTemplates`.
Each `ChatMessageTemplate` contains instructions for how to format that `ChatMessage` - its role, and then also its content.
Let's take a look at this below:

```typescript
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";

const template =
  "You are a helpful assistant that translates {input_language} to {output_language}.";
const humanTemplate = "{text}";

const chatPrompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
  ["system", template],
  ["human", humanTemplate],
]);

await chatPrompt.formatMessages({
  input_language: "English",
  output_language: "French",
  text: "I love programming.",
});
```

```typescript
[
  SystemMessage {
    content: 'You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French.'
  },
  HumanMessage {
    content: 'I love programming.'
  }
]
```

ChatPromptTemplates can also be constructed in other ways - see the [section on prompts](/docs/modules/model_io/prompts) for more detail.

## Output parsers

`OutputParser`s convert the raw output of a language model into a format that can be used downstream.
There are a few main types of `OutputParser`s, including:

- Convert text from `LLM` into structured information (e.g. JSON)
- Convert a `ChatMessage` into just a string
- Convert the extra information returned from a call besides the message (like OpenAI function invocation) into a string.

For full information on this, see the [section on output parsers](/docs/modules/model_io/output_parsers).

```typescript
import { CommaSeparatedListOutputParser } from "langchain/output_parsers";

const parser = new CommaSeparatedListOutputParser();
await parser.invoke("hi, bye");
// ['hi', 'bye']
```

## Composing with LCEL

We can now combine all these into one chain.
This chain will take input variables, pass those to a prompt template to create a prompt, pass the prompt to a language model, and then pass the output through an (optional) output parser.
This is a convenient way to bundle up a modular piece of logic.
Let's see it in action!

```typescript
const chain = chatPrompt.pipe(chatModel).pipe(parser);
await chain.invoke({ text: "colors" });
// ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow', 'orange']
```

Note that we are using the `.pipe()` method to join these components together.
This `.pipe()` method is powered by the LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) and relies on the universal `Runnable` interface that all of these objects implement.
To learn more about LCEL, read the documentation [here](/docs/expression_language).
