# Streaming

Some Chat models provide a streaming response. This means that instead of waiting for the entire response to be returned, you can start processing it as soon as it's available. This is useful if you want to display the response to the user as it's being generated, or if you want to process the response as it's being generated.

## Using `.stream()`

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

The easiest way to stream is to use the `.stream()` method. This returns an readable stream that you can also iterate over:

import StreamMethodExample from "@examples/models/chat/chat_streaming_stream_method.ts";

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai
```

import UnifiedModelParamsTooltip from "@mdx_components/unified_model_params_tooltip.mdx";

<UnifiedModelParamsTooltip></UnifiedModelParamsTooltip>

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{StreamMethodExample}</CodeBlock>

For models that do not support streaming, the entire response will be returned as a single chunk.

For convenience, you can also pipe a chat model into a [StringOutputParser](/docs/modules/model_io/output_parsers/types/string) to extract
just the raw string values from each chunk:

import StringExample from "@examples/prompts/string_output_parser.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{StringExample}</CodeBlock>

You can also do something similar to stream bytes directly (e.g. for returning a stream in an HTTP response) using the [HttpResponseOutputParser](/docs/modules/model_io/output_parsers/types/http_response):

import HttpExample from "@examples/prompts/http_response_output_parser.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{HttpExample}</CodeBlock>

## Using a callback handler

You can also use a [`CallbackHandler`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs/blob/main/langchain/src/callbacks/base.ts) like so:

import StreamingExample from "@examples/models/chat/chat_streaming.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{StreamingExample}</CodeBlock>
