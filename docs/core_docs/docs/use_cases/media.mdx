# Audio/Video Structured Extraction

Google's Gemini API offers support for audio and video input, along with function calling.
Together, we can pair these API features to extract structured data given audio or video input.

In the following examples, we'll demonstrate how to read and send MP3 and MP4 files to the Gemini API, and receive structured output as a response.

## Setup

These examples use the Gemini API, so you'll need a Google VertexAI credentials file (or stringified credentials file if using a web environment):

```bash
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="credentials.json"
```

Next, install the `@langchain/google-vertexai` and `@langchain/community` packages:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/google-vertexai @langchain/core
```

## Video

This example uses a [LangChain YouTube video on datasets and testing in LangSmith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9hjO-Uy1Vo) sped up to 1.5x speed.
It's then converted to `base64`, and sent to Gemini with a prompt asking for structured output of tasks I can do to improve my knowledge of datasets and testing in LangSmith.

We create a new tool for this using Zod, and pass it to the model via the `withStructuredOutput` method.

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

import VideoExample from "@examples/use_cases/media/video.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{VideoExample}</CodeBlock>

## Audio

The next example loads an audio (MP3) file containing Mozart's Requiem in D Minor and prompts Gemini to return a single array of strings, with each string being an instrument from the song.

Here, we'll also use the `withStructuredOutput` method to get structured output from the model.

import AudioExample from "@examples/use_cases/media/audio.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{AudioExample}</CodeBlock>

From a quick Google search, we see the song was composed using the following instruments:

```txt
The Requiem is scored for 2 basset horns in F, 2 bassoons, 2 trumpets in D, 3 trombones (alto, tenor, and bass),
timpani (2 drums), violins, viola, and basso continuo (cello, double bass, and organ).
```

Gemini did pretty well here! For music not being its primary focus, it was able to identify a few of the instruments used in the song, and didn't hallucinate any!
