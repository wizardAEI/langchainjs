    "One of the common types of databases that we can build Q&A systems for are graph databases. LangChain comes with a number of built-in chains and agents that are compatible with graph query language dialects like Cypher, Neo4j, and MemGraph. They enable use cases such as:\n",

    "* Generating queries that will be run based on natural language questions,\n",
    "* Creating chatbots that can answer questions based on database data,\n",

    "## ⚠️ Security note ⚠️\n",
    "\n",
    "Building Q&A systems of graph databases might require executing model-generated database queries. There are inherent risks in doing this. Make sure that your database connection permissions are always scoped as narrowly as possible for your chain/agent's needs. This will mitigate though not eliminate the risks of building a model-driven system. For more on general security best practices, [see here](/docs/security).\n",

    "> Employing database query templates within a semantic layer provides the advantage of bypassing the need for database query generation. This approach effectively eradicates security vulnerabilities linked to the generation of database queries.\n",
